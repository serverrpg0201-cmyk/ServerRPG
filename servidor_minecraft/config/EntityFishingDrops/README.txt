                        ENTITY FISHING DROPS MOD
                           Complete Guide
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
This mod allows server administrators to configure custom drops, commands, and
effects that trigger when players catch fish or other fishing items. Perfect
for adding rewards, events, and custom fishing mechanics to your server.

The mod uses a clean JSON format that only includes the fields you actually need,
making configuration files easier to read and maintain.

================================================================================
                            ACTIVE EVENTS
================================================================================

Events allow you to create seasonal or special fishing rewards:

AVAILABLE EVENTS:
- Easter: Spring-themed rewards
- Winter: Cold weather bonuses
- Summer: Warm weather rewards
- Halloween: Spooky seasonal drops
- Christmas: Holiday celebration items

HOW TO USE EVENTS:
1. Create event folder: Event Drops/Halloween/
2. Add JSON files with special drops
3. Enable with: /fishingdrops event Halloween true
4. Event stays active until disabled
5. Active events are saved in Active_Events.json

When events are active:
- Normal Drops are ALWAYS loaded
- Event Drops are ADDED to normal drops
- Players get more rewards during events
- Multiple events can be active simultaneously

================================================================================
                            BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

ORGANIZATION:
- Use descriptive file names (minecraft_cod.json, rare_drops.json)
- Group related drops in same files
- Use comments to document your configurations
- Keep Global_Fishing_Drops.json for server-wide effects
- Only include fields you actually need (cleaner JSON)

BALANCING:
- Start with low drop chances (1-10%) for rare items
- Use cooldowns on powerful commands
- Test with dropChance: 100.0 during development
- Consider server economy when adding valuable drops

PERFORMANCE:
- Avoid too many complex conditions
- Use reasonable cooldowns on commands
- Don't create hundreds of drop entries
- Group similar drops in single files

PLAYER EXPERIENCE:
- Use tellraw commands to notify players of special drops
- Create themed events for holidays
- Balance rewards with server progression
- Provide variety in drop types and commands

JSON FORMATTING:
- Only include fields you need (mod ignores null/default values)
- Use proper JSON syntax validation
- Keep comments descriptive but concise
- Organize entries logically within files

================================================================================
                           TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

DROPS NOT WORKING:
1. Check server console for error messages
2. Verify JSON syntax (use online JSON validator)
3. Ensure mod is installed and loaded
4. Use /fishingdrops reload after changes
5. Test with dropChance: 100.0 for guaranteed triggers
6. Check that required conditions are met (weather, biome, etc.)

COMMANDS NOT EXECUTING:
1. Check command syntax and permissions
2. Verify placeholder usage ({player}, etc.)
3. Test commands manually in server console
4. Check cooldowns aren't preventing execution
5. Ensure commandChance is set appropriately

MODDED ITEMS NOT WORKING:
1. Verify correct mod:item format (e.g., "thermal:silver_ingot")
2. Check if mod is installed and loaded
3. Use /give command to test item IDs
4. Check mod's documentation for correct item names
5. Ensure mod is loaded before EntityFishingDrops

JSON SYNTAX ERRORS:
1. Use online JSON validator
2. Check for missing commas, quotes, brackets
3. Ensure proper escaping of quotes in NBT data
4. Remove trailing commas from last entries
5. Verify all strings are properly quoted

EVENT ISSUES:
1. Check Active_Events.json for enabled events
2. Verify event folder exists and has JSON files
3. Use /fishingdrops event <name> false then true to reset
4. Check server logs for loading errors
5. Ensure event names match folder names exactly

CLEAN JSON NOT GENERATING:
1. Ensure you're using the latest version
2. Delete existing files to regenerate clean versions
3. Check that only needed fields are being set in code
4. Verify Gson configuration excludes null values

================================================================================
                              SUPPORT
================================================================================

For additional help:
- Check server console logs for detailed error messages
- Test configurations in creative mode for faster iteration
- Start with simple examples and add complexity gradually
- Use /fishingdrops reload frequently during testing
- Backup configurations before making major changes

The mod generates clean, minimal JSON files that only include the fields you
actually use, making them easier to read and maintain.

DEBUGGING TIPS:
- Enable debug logging for detailed information
- Test one configuration at a time
- Use simple drop chances (like 100.0) during testing
- Verify item IDs with /give commands first
- Check that events are properly enabled

Remember: Always backup your configurations before making major changes!
